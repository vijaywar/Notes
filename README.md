#Components

First we stat with App.js here I added routing using "react-router-dom".<br>
App.js also import Navbar.js component from componet/nav folder and set<br> on top of all components to visible in all pages.
<br>
It has 2 routs<br>
/ and /about 2 routs are added to this simple app.<br>
/ will render Home.js component. I has the input form that allows used to inter input.<br>

in Home component on submit of the form it will pass data to the getwords() function this fetch the data asynchronously using fetch().tech() methods<br>
once the data is fetched it will set the state data value and then call GetTopWords() funciton.
This funciton will update the state dictionary with top N frequency words.

as the sate gets update React will automatically update the state every where which results in call of <br>
Table component it will create table using the data pased as props.

In Table this will receive the top N frequency words object in the form of props and crate a Table and display it to users.


About.js component is all about me any my skills. Please check my skills match this role really well.<br>

Please give me a opportunity I am interested in both web and Android Deveopment.
I am quick learner and hard worker.
